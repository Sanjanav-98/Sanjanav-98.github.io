A CNN model was trained which performed COVID-19 detection on Lung CT Scan and achieved an accuracy of 98.26%. Implemented lung segmentation and infection mask prediction using U-Net architecture and attained a DICE score of 0.9802 and 0.8710 respectively. Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) was used to enhance the contrast of medical images
